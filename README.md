# RecoveryTheorem

The project is going to be focused on the article "The Recovery Theorem" by Steve Ross (2015) and focused on the empirical estimation of the returns distribution from the options data.
We would like to apply the Recovery Theorem to divide the state prices into the risk aversion component and the estimation of probability distribution and returns. This separation lets us get the pricing kernel, market risk premium, and the tail events probabilities in a model-independent fashion.
While some applications are used to check the Efficient Market Hypothesis, we would like to focus the work on the opportunities for more robust estimation of the probability densities, which show very transient behavior, using the techniques such as the Kalman Filter or other smoothing methodologies.
Moreover, the particular interest in the estimation lies in the application of the resulted methodology to the SOFR Options, which gained a lot of interest in recent years due to the transition from LIBOR. After this, we will be able to create an asset-independent framework applicable to any type of option.
The result of the work will be the application of the robust probability densities for returns forecast for the given asset class to measure the predictive power of the estimates.
The overall work will include working with the original model and extension of it for more robust estimations, data collection and cleaning for the SOFR options prices, using the trading terminals, estimation framework development, and forecastability hypothesis testing using Python.
